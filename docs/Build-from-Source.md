## Prerequisites

Before you begin building JioTV Go from source, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Golang Installed**: Make sure you have [Golang](https://golang.org/) installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download and install it from the official website.

2. **Access to JioTV Go Source Code**: You should have access to the JioTV Go source code, typically available in a Git repository.

## Steps to Build JioTV Go from Source

Here are the steps to build JioTV Go from its source code:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Start by cloning the JioTV Go repository to your local machine:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/rabilrbl/jiotv_go.git
